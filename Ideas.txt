- Create separate MatchSummary class or possibly a method on the Match class to return the summary,
  consider ditching summary altogether and just working with full match details (extracting summary information as required.
  
- Depending on decision re-implement parsing of match summaries and localise to relevant method

- Update constants (should be automated via build command)?

- Design full match detail screen

- Implement custom minimalist CSS for table (consider alternatives to current approach to tabular display as well).
  
- Revisit Angular Material to explore theming (custom black/gray and red theme?) and for Tabular display and other controls that might be   effective for displaying match stats, will give app a nice uniform visual appeal.

- Put table display and individual match display into sub-components under matches component. 

- Make a dashboard component displaying the next match in the challenge (maybe other statistics? Whimsy and my stats on the given heroes?)

- Look into End to End testing (protractor?)
